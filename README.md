# Story Graph
A new way to tell your stories.  Using machine learning, we develop a human understanding of a short story and visually convey it in almost realtime- that is, we build a scene of the story, it's characters, places, actions and even tone.  Simply talk your story out loud as you normally would and story graph will listen in as your friendly neighbor.

We think this is useful for kids stories- say a parent reading a bedtime story and story graph will visually paint the story scene and environment as it happens.

The vision of this is to integrate with virtual reality so that near lifelike visuals are manifested as a story is being told.
